# 2018_winter_internship @ GUGC
supervisor: Mijung Kim

## During this 2018 winter internship program, students will learn:

  - Basic Knowledge in Machine Learning
  - The concept of virtual environment, and thereby how to use docker, or any other virtual environment tools.
  
  
## Initial steps before anything:

### Downloading Docker:

####  1. For Linux and Mac users:
      
    Follow the link below for general instruction of docker:
      
      https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
    
    Make sure you download the Community Edition (CE), which is free. Ofcourse, make sure the installer matches your OS.


####  2. For Windows users:
    
    If your computer runs a Windows 10 Pro, or has Windows Server 2016, follow the same procedures as for Linux and Mac.
    
    Else, it's a completely different story - you need to download a docker toolbox for windows from the following links:
    
      https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/#step-2-install-docker-toolbox
    
    Run the file to install toolbox, and then you will see three items popped up on your desktop: 
    
       - Docker Quickstart Terminal
       - Oracle VM VirtualBox
       - Kitematic (Alpha)
    
    Ignore Oracle VM VirtualBox! You won't be using this program (at least during this internship program)
    
    Run Kitematic (Alpha). You will see a page full of boxes that represent docker images. All you need is the very first item on the top left corner: 'hello-world-gnix'
    Click 'CREATE' button. It's a blue rectangular button with blue edges that every item has.
    
    Now you have the appropriate container. Close Kitematic (Alpha), and open Docker Quickstart Terminal. a command window will pop up. Wait for the program to do some initializing - when it's done, a pixel-whale will show up.
